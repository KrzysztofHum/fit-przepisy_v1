A react news app utilising GatsbyJs and contentful hosted on netlify. https://fit-przepisy.netlify.app/

## About the build

Besides enjoying the content, I found the Gatsby extensive documentation and support a great resource to use for this project. The idea was to create a quick page where I will post my recipes. The website is mainly used to show my recipes.

## Functionality

###### Sections

There are presented my recipes. You can clik for the image and open recipe with preparation tips. You can also search for recipes containing only selected tags.

###### Misc

By Contentful i can easily add new recipes and tags.

## Style

For styling i used styled components which improved the readability of the code. Additionally made my worker easier even though it was only the first project when i use it.
